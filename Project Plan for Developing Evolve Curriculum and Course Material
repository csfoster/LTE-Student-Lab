# **Project Plan for Developing Evolve Curriculum and Course Material**

## Objective
To create the advanced curriculum and course materials required to train students to become QC Broadband Technical Support Resource Employees. This plan assumes one person will handle the development of all materials.

---

## Timeline Overview

- **Duration**: 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Milestones**: Divided into key phases, each focusing on a set of course modules.

---

## **Phase 1: Planning and Preparation**

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Deliverables**:

- Finalized syllabus.
- Detailed list of topics and learning objectives for each course.
- Collection of existing resources and tools (e.g., Baicell documentation, Open Source EPC guides).

### Detailed Tasks:

1. Review and refine the syllabus based on program objectives.
2. Develop a comprehensive list of learning objectives for each module.
3. Research and collect technical documentation and resources from OEMs (e.g., Baicell, Juniper).
4. Identify and list tools, lab equipment, and software required for the course.
5. Create a project management schedule with deadlines for each phase.

## **Phase 2: LTE/5G Network Fundamentals**

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Deliverables**:

- Lecture slides and reference materials for LTE/5G architecture, including eNodeB, EPC, antennas, and CPE.
- Hands-on guides for installing and configuring a 4G/5G Open Source EPC.

### Detailed Tasks:

1. Develop lecture materials covering LTE/5G architecture, components, and use cases.
2. Create detailed guides for setting up and configuring Open Source EPC solutions.
3. Draft materials illustrating the role of eNodeBs, EPCs, and antennas in fixed-wireless deployments.
4. Develop the lab exercises that simulate various element failures of eNodeBs, EPCs, switches, or physical communication links between these elements. Scenarios could include power outages at the eNodeB, configuration errors in the EPC, physical cable disconnections between switches, and router misconfigurations. Students will use tools such as packet sniffers, CLI diagnostics, and monitoring dashboards to identify, isolate, and resolve each type of issue.
5. Test and validate configuration and failure simulation steps to ensure accuracy.

## **Phase 3: Hands-On LTE Network Operations**

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Deliverables**:

- Configuration guides for Baicell eNodeBs and antennas.
- Troubleshooting playbooks for RF propagation and signal issues.
- CPE installation and configuration manuals.

### Detailed Tasks:

1. Develop lab exercises for configuring Baicell eNodeBs and antennas.
2. Write troubleshooting guides for common RF signal issues and propagation challenges.
3. Create custom step-by-step instructions for CPE installation and configuration. For the CPE devices that QC Broadband will deploy and off-the-shelf cell phones, note that only Internet connectivity will be tested on cell phones. Voice and messaging services will not be covered in this program.
4. Design troubleshooting scenarios to simulate real-world connectivity issues, such as bandwidth limitations, latency spikes, hardware malfunctions, and misconfigurations in network elements. These scenarios will provide hands-on experience in diagnosing and resolving diverse network problems.
5. Validate all exercises and scenarios through testing, ensuring both successful and unsuccessful outcomes are explored to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## **Phase 5: SIM Card Provisioning and Management**

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Deliverables**:

- PySim setup and configuration guide.
- Lab exercises for SIM card provisioning and device authentication.

### Detailed Tasks:

1. Write detailed instructions for installing and configuring PySim.
2. Develop exercises for SIM card provisioning, including managing profiles and testing connectivity.
3. Create troubleshooting guides for common SIM-related issues.
4. Validate exercises and guides through practical testing.

## **Phase 6: Capstone Project and Final Documentation of Building a Complete End-to-End System (CPE to Internet)**

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Deliverables**:

- Capstone project description and grading rubric.
- Finalized course materials, including all guides, slides, and reference documents. These materials will be organized into a digital repository, with separate folders for each module. Students will access these resources via a structured online platform, ensuring easy navigation and accessibility. Hard copies will also be made available for critical reference guides.

### Detailed Tasks:

1. Define clear requirements and deliverables for the capstone project.
2. Create a grading rubric to evaluate student performance.
3. Assemble all course materials into a cohesive package.
4. Review and finalize all documentation for clarity and accuracy.
5. Conduct a final walkthrough of the program to ensure alignment with objectives.
