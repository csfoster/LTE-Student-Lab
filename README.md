# High-Level syllabus - QC Broadband Technical Support Training Program 

**Objective:**  
To develop students into skilled technical support professionals capable of supporting QC Broadbandâ€™s LTE broadband network and participate in the QC Broadband intern program.

On day one, students will use a smartphone to access the internet over a complete end-to-end LTE system in a lab. On day two, students will break down an element, learn its function, and gain hands-on experience in troubleshooting, installing, and configuring each element end to end. The final project will involve building an entire system, including configuring a SIM card in a smartphone and configuring a LTE Linux Router to the internet.
